Hello!

this game is very moddable!

All source and content are easily editable, common formats: 
	.tga for images
	.wav for sound
	.obj for static meshes.
	.cpp for source code (yep, all the source code is free, written by me, CC0 / Public Domain. Do whatever you want with it.)
	.shader for shader code, bundling vertex and pixel shader into one file.
	.mesh and .anim files contain skinned (animated) models and animations. These formats are custom and need to be exported from blender with a provided python script. (export.py)
	
Hotreloading assets:
	Edit any .tga, .wav, .obj or .shader file while the game is running. Yep. That's it.

Hotreloading code c++:
	1. rename "build2.bat" to "build.bat"
	2. install clang
		Download is here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases
		The right one (on windows) is called something like "LLVM-14.0.6-win64.exe"
	3. To test if installation was successfull, open cmd anywhere and type "clang --version". 
		If you get any kind of error you should check your install, make sure clang was added to the system %path%.
	4. Now any changes to .cpp file should hotreload!
	
BEWARE!
Using mods made by others poses massive security risks! A modded DLL could easily get you hacked or break your windows install.
Basically, by modding the game you are taking the seatbelt off. Proceed at your own risk. :)
